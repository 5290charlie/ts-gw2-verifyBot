# This script is intended to be used as an automatic form of Teamspeak authentication for Guild Wars 2.

# REQUIRES:
* Python 3.4
* Third Party Modules = [ts3:'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ts3/0.6.6, 
                        gw2api:'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gw2api']
                        
NOTE: gw2api by author 'hackedd' is clean and simple but for some reason one line of code was throwing the v2/endpoint.py off in Python 3.4 (was fine in 2.7). However, I had to use 3.4 so I tweaked his code as follows:

File: v2/endpoint.py

Original:
for key, link in r.links.iteritems():

Fixed:
for key, link in r.links.items():



TODO:
With recent WvW server merging a server mate and myself are working to tweak the code for multiple servers and some othe minor things shortly.



Please modify the bot.conf variables as needed.
